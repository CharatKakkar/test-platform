            "Maintaining network infrastructure"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 2,
          "explanation": "When using PaaS services like Azure SQL Database, the cloud provider (Microsoft) is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure, network, and database software. The customer is responsible for their data and access control. This is part of the shared responsibility model where data security and access control always remain the customer's responsibility."

            "A third-party security company"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "The cloud provider is always responsible for physical security of the datacenter, including physical access controls, power, cooling, and network connectivity. This is a fundamental part of the shared responsibility model that cannot be transferred to the customer."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Private cloud provides the most control over resources and security because it's dedicated to a single organization. This allows for complete customization of security policies, resource allocation, and infrastructure management."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 2,
          "explanation": "A hybrid cloud model is ideal for this scenario as it allows the company to keep sensitive data in their private cloud/on-premises while leveraging public cloud services for development. This provides both security and flexibility."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "One of the main advantages of public cloud is that organizations don't need to make capital expenditures to scale up. They can quickly provision resources and only pay for what they use, making it more cost-effective for many scenarios."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "A multi-cloud environment involves using multiple public cloud providers. This could be because an organization uses different features from different providers or is in the process of migrating between providers."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 2,
          "explanation": "A hybrid cloud model is ideal for handling temporary spikes in demand because it allows the company to maintain their base infrastructure in a private cloud while bursting to public cloud resources when additional capacity is needed."

            "Use management groups for organization"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "For temporary environments like development, placing all resources in a single resource group is ideal because you can easily deprovision all resources at once by deleting the resource group. This simplifies management and cleanup."

          "correctAnswer": 2,
          "explanation": "A fundamental rule of Azure resource groups is that a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. While resources can be moved between resource groups, they cannot exist in multiple groups simultaneously."

            "Different Azure accounts"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Subscriptions are the primary unit for billing in Azure. By creating separate subscriptions for production and development, the company can get separate billing reports and invoices, making it easier to track and manage costs for each environment."

          "options": [
            "Apply the policy to each subscription individually",
            "Create a management group and apply the policy to it",
            "Use resource groups to apply the policy",
            "Create a new subscription with the policy"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Management groups allow you to apply policies to multiple subscriptions at once. When you apply a policy to a management group, all subscriptions within that group automatically inherit the policy, making it more efficient than applying policies individually."

            "Apply the policy to resource groups",
            "Apply the policy to a management group containing production subscriptions",
            "Apply the policy to individual subscriptions"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 2,
          "explanation": "By applying the location policy to a management group containing all production subscriptions, the policy will automatically apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. This ensures consistent governance across all production resources."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 3,
          "explanation": "Grouping related resources is typically handled by resource groups, not subscriptions. Subscriptions are used for billing, access control, and environment separation, while resource groups are used for logical organization of resources."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Creating three subscriptions under a single management group is the best approach because: 1) Each department gets separate billing and cost tracking, 2) Different security policies can be applied per subscription, 3) The management group can enforce organization-wide compliance policies, and 4) It provides clear separation of resources while maintaining centralized governance."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Creating two subscriptions under a management group is ideal because: 1) The management group can enforce HIPAA compliance policies across all subscriptions, 2) Development and production environments are completely isolated, 3) Each subscription can have its own access controls, 4) Cost tracking is separated between environments, and 5) The management group ensures consistent security policies."
